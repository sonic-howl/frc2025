  This class is where the bulk of the robot should be declared. Since Command-based is a
  "declarative" paradigm, very little robot logic should actually be handled in the :class:`.Robot`
  periodic methods (other than the scheduler calls). Instead, the structure of the robot (including
  subsystems, commands, and button mappings) should be declared here.
